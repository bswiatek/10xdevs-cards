# Review View Implementation - Status Report

## Implementation Date
January 11, 2025

## Overview
Successfully implemented the complete Review View frontend according to the implementation plan. The view allows users to review, accept, edit, or reject AI-generated flashcard candidates and save them as a flashcard set.

## Implemented Components

### 1. Types and View Models (`src/types.ts`)
Added the following UI-specific types:
- `ReviewCandidateVM`: View model for candidate flashcards with UI state
- `ReviewCounters`: Counters for accepted/rejected/remaining candidates
- `EditModalState`: State management for edit modal
- `ReviewState`: Complete state structure for the review view

### 2. Custom Hook (`src/components/hooks/useReviewSession.ts`)
Implemented `useReviewSession` hook with:
- Initialization from `GenerationSessionDTO`
- Candidate management (accept, reject, undo, edit)
- Counter recalculation (O(1) updates)
- Modal state management
- Session data retrieval helpers

### 3. UI Components

#### CandidateCard (`src/components/review/CandidateCard.tsx`)
- Displays front/back of flashcard
- Visual states: green border for accepted, red border for rejected
- Actions: Accept, Edit, Reject (for pending), Undo (for accepted/rejected)
- "Edited" badge for modified candidates

#### CandidateList (`src/components/review/CandidateList.tsx`)
- Scrollable list of candidate cards
- Empty state message when no candidates
- Delegates all actions to individual cards

#### ReviewHeader (`src/components/review/ReviewHeader.tsx`)
- Sticky header with counters
- Shows: Accepted, Rejected, Remaining counts with icons
- "Save Set" button (disabled when accepted count is 0)
- Warning message when no accepted candidates

#### EditCandidateModal (`src/components/review/EditCandidateModal.tsx`)
- Dialog for editing flashcard content
- Real-time validation: front (1-200 chars), back (1-500 chars)
- Character counters with visual feedback
- Error messages below fields
- Saves changes and marks candidate as "edited"

#### SaveSetTitleModal (`src/components/review/SaveSetTitleModal.tsx`)
- Dialog for entering set title before saving
- Title validation: 1-200 characters
- Character counter
- Displays count of accepted candidates
- Loading state during save

### 4. Main Component (`src/components/ReviewView.tsx`)
The orchestrator component that:
- Loads session data from sessionStorage
- Manages review state via useReviewSession hook
- Handles API call to POST /api/flashcard-sets
- Error handling for all API error codes (400, 404, 422, 500)
- Toast notifications for success/error
- Automatic redirect to sets list after successful save
- Fallback UI when no session data available

### 5. Astro Page (`src/pages/review/[sessionId].astro`)
- Dynamic route with sessionId parameter
- Validates sessionId (must be valid number)
- Loads ReviewView with client:load directive
- Includes Toaster for notifications
- Redirects to generate page if invalid session

### 6. Integration Updates

#### useGenerateForm hook (`src/components/hooks/useGenerateForm.ts`)
Updated to:
- Store GenerationSessionDTO in sessionStorage
- Redirect to `/review/[sessionId]` after successful generation
- Use route params instead of query params

## Features Implemented

### Core Functionality
✅ Accept candidates
✅ Reject candidates  
✅ Edit candidates with validation
✅ Undo actions (restore to pending)
✅ Real-time counter updates
✅ Save flashcard set with title
✅ Session data persistence via sessionStorage

### Validation
✅ Front field: 1-200 characters
✅ Back field: 1-500 characters
✅ Set title: 1-200 characters
✅ Minimum 1 accepted/edited candidate to save
✅ Real-time character counters

### Error Handling
✅ 400 Bad Request: Shows validation details
✅ 404 Not Found: Session doesn't exist
✅ 422 Unprocessable: Session already used
✅ 500 Server Error: Generic error message
✅ Network errors: Connection issues
✅ Missing session data: Redirect to generate page

### User Experience
✅ Visual feedback for accepted (green) and rejected (red) cards
✅ "Edited" badge for modified candidates
✅ Loading states during save
✅ Success toast with redirect after save
✅ Sticky header with always-visible counters
✅ Responsive layout
✅ Dark mode support via Tailwind variants
✅ Accessible with proper ARIA labels

## API Integration

### Endpoints Used
- `POST /api/flashcard-sets`: Creates new flashcard set from candidates

### Request Format
```typescript
{
  title: string,
  generation_session_id: number,
  flashcards: FlashcardCandidateWithActionDTO[]
}
```

### Response Handling
- Success (201): Shows toast, redirects to sets list
- Errors: Displays appropriate error messages

## Navigation Flow

1. User generates flashcards at `/generate`
2. After successful generation → redirects to `/review/[sessionId]`
3. Session data stored in sessionStorage
4. User reviews candidates (accept/edit/reject)
5. User clicks "Save Set" → enters title
6. After successful save → redirects to `/sets`

## Technical Details

### State Management
- Local React state via custom hooks
- SessionStorage for session data persistence
- O(1) counter updates for performance

### Styling
- Tailwind CSS 4 with utility classes
- Shadcn/ui components (Card, Dialog, Button, Input, Textarea, Label)
- Responsive design with mobile-first approach
- Dark mode support

### Dependencies Added
Installed Shadcn/ui components:
- card
- dialog
- textarea
- label
- input
- sonner (toast notifications)

## Compliance with Implementation Plan

The implementation strictly follows the provided implementation plan:

✅ All components from plan implemented
✅ All types defined as specified
✅ All interactions implemented as described
✅ API integration matches specification
✅ Error handling covers all specified cases
✅ Validation rules match plan requirements
✅ Routing structure follows plan
✅ State management as designed

## Compliance with Implementation Rules

✅ Uses Astro for page routing
✅ Uses React for interactive components
✅ Follows Tailwind CSS best practices
✅ Uses Shadcn/ui components
✅ Implements proper error handling with early returns
✅ Follows clean code guidelines
✅ No "use client" directives (not Next.js)
✅ Proper TypeScript types throughout
✅ Accessible with ARIA attributes
✅ Responsive design

## Known Limitations

1. **Session Data Persistence**: Uses sessionStorage which is cleared when browser tab closes. This is by design per PRD - no support for returning to abandoned review sessions.

2. **No GET endpoint for sessions**: Cannot reload a review session after navigation away. This is intentional per PRD MVP scope.

3. **Default redirect**: After saving, redirects to `/sets` list. Individual set detail page `/sets/[id]` may not exist yet.

## Testing Recommendations

1. Test full flow: Generate → Review → Save
2. Test all candidate actions: Accept, Reject, Edit, Undo
3. Test validation in edit modal
4. Test save with various candidate counts
5. Test all error scenarios (400, 404, 422, 500)
6. Test session data persistence across page reloads
7. Test responsive design on mobile
8. Test dark mode
9. Test accessibility with screen reader

## Next Steps

1. Create `/sets` page for flashcard set list
2. Create `/sets/[id]` page for individual set detail
3. Add integration tests
4. Add E2E tests with Playwright
5. Performance optimization if needed

## Conclusion

The Review View has been fully implemented according to the specification. All required features, validation, error handling, and user interactions are in place. The implementation follows all coding guidelines and integrates properly with the existing Generate View.
